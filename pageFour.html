		<h3>The Habit Line</h3>

		<p>In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions, (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold--the habit line--the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.</p>
		<h3>Decisive Moments</h3>

		<p>The difference between a good day and a bad day is osten a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the orad, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.</p>
		<h3>The Two-Minute Rule</h3>
		<p>The Two-Minute Rule states, "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."</p>
		<h3>The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h3>
		<h4>3.1 Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.</h4>
		<h4>3.2 Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.</h4>
		<h4>3.3 Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.</h4>
		<h4>3.4 Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.</h4>
		<h4>3.5 Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchase that lock in future behavior.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of the 3rd Law - 3.6 Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.</h4>
		<h4> Inversion of the 3rd Law - 3.7 Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.</h4>
